                    I'm a second-year undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz majoring in applied mathematics. Computing is the area that is of my most interest where mathematics is being applied. During my free time, I enjoy coding and playing around with my devices, which led to several of my innovative projects.

                    Currently, I’m working in a research lab on automated agents to make Robotic Process Automation (RPAs) more accurate and efficient. Seeing a lack of competent app stores in the desktop market segment, I’m also the first to make a proof-of-concept of a truly cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) desktop app store with a consistent graphical user interface. Being the co-founder and CTO of Studify, I have also developed tools for students to strengthen their knowledge or clarify confusions, such as introducing lecture transcriptions and tailored study guides.
